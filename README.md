# User_Experience_Design_Prototype
Prototype site made for part of my project with User Experience Design. Low-fidelity wireframes were created, a user persona, and guerilla testing were conducted prior to the final revisions of the wireframes. I tried keeping the design simple not to over complicate the project as complexity is not the purpose of this project. Attached is the design process that this protoype has gone through.
